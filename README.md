# Stress Detection Using PPG and HRV Features

This project focuses on detecting stress levels using photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals by analyzing heart rate variability (HRV) metrics and applying machine learning techniques.

## ðŸ”¬ Background

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a proven physiological marker of stress. By extracting time and frequency domain features from PPG signals, this project explores how stress can be detected and classified using data science methods.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- NeuroKit2, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- (Optional) Streamlit for interactive dashboard

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

We are using the [WESAD dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/WESAD), which contains multimodal data (PPG, ECG, accelerometer) collected from wearable sensors during stress-inducing tasks.

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Clean and preprocess raw PPG signals
- Extract HRV features using NeuroKit2
- Train ML classifiers to predict stress states
- (Optional) Deploy a stress monitoring dashboard

## ðŸ¤– ML Models

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Random Forest
